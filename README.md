String manipulation
Contents
Printing Programs

hello_world.py → Prints "Hello, World!"
name_age.py → Displays user name and age
Keywords & Type Checking

print_keywords.py → Prints all predefined Python keywords
check_keyword.py → Checks if a given word is a Python keyword
Mutability Demonstrations

mutable_vs_immutable.py → Shows how lists (mutable) and tuples (immutable) behave differently
User Input and Type Casting

type_casting.py → Converts user input to integer, float, and boolean
Control Flow and Loops

conditional_statements.py → Checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero
for_loop.py → Prints numbers from 1 to 10
sum_even_numbers.py → Finds the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50
reverse_string.py → Reverses a string using a while loop
factorial.py → Calculates the factorial of a user-provided number using a while loop
